### Abstract
Drug reviews play a very significant role in providing crucial medical care information for
both healthcare professionals and consumers. Customers are utilizing online review sites to
voice opinions and express sentiments about experienced drugs. However, a potential buyer
typically finds it very hard to go through all comments before making a purchase decision.
Another big challenge is the unstructured and textual nature of the reviews, which makes it
difficult for readers to classify comments into meaningful insights.For these reasons, this
project primarily aims to classify the drugs according to their usefulness for each medical condition and effectiveness level of prescribed
drugs by using text analytics and predictive models
